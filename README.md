**Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization Project**

This project focuses on analyzing real-time traffic accident data from state government portals to uncover insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and high-risk areas. The project leverages a comprehensive data pipeline, integrating tools such as Alteryx, Azure Data Factory, Talend, Snowflake, Tableau, and Power BI for an end-to-end solution.

**Project Overview**
Traffic accidents are a significant concern for urban planning and traffic management. This project addresses the need for actionable insights by:

Collecting and analyzing 4.5M+ rows of real-time traffic data from state government portals of New York, Chicago, and Austin.
Automating data staging, cleaning, and transformation processes to ensure data quality and accessibility.
Visualizing trends and patterns through interactive dashboards to help stakeholders implement data-driven decisions.
Tools and Technologies Used
Alteryx: Data profiling to identify and resolve inconsistencies in raw datasets.
Azure Data Factory: Automated staging of TSV files by converting them to Parquet format and loading them into Snowflake.
Snowflake: Cloud-based database for storing and managing large volumes of structured data.
Talend: Data cleaning, transformation, and merging using components like tMap, tUnite, and tNormalize.
Tableau: Visualization of accident trends, injuries, fatalities, and other insights through interactive dashboards.
Power BI: Development of additional visualizations with dynamic filtering and user-friendly interfaces.
Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Sourced real-time traffic accident data from government portals of New York, Chicago, and Austin.
Included attributes such as accident counts, injuries, fatalities, contributing factors, and geographic data (latitude and longitude).
2. Data Profiling
Used Alteryx to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in the dataset.
Ensured data quality and accuracy for downstream processes.
3. Automated Data Staging
Azure Data Factory was used to automate the process of:
Converting raw TSV files to Parquet format.
Loading Parquet files into Snowflake for efficient storage and querying.
4. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Developed ETL workflows in Talend:
Used tMap for complex mapping and transformation.
Utilized tUnite for merging datasets.
Applied tNormalize to standardize and flatten data structures.
Merged and transformed data into a single, clean dataset ready for analysis.
5. Data Analysis and Visualization
Created interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to visualize:
Accident counts by city, street, and time of day.
Injury and fatality trends.
High-risk areas and top contributing factors.
Time-based patterns (e.g., seasonality, weekdays/weekends).
Enabled actionable insights for traffic management and preventive measures.
Key Insights and Deliverables
Accident Counts:
Identified top cities and areas with the highest accident rates.
Seasonality Analysis:
Determined peak accident periods (by quarter and day of the week).
Contributing Factors:
Highlighted common causes of accidents (e.g., speeding, failure to yield).
Pedestrian and Motorist Impact:
Analyzed pedestrian involvement and compared fatalities with road users.
Fatal Accident Hotspots:
Mapped high-risk areas using geographic data for targeted interventions.
